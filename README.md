# Hackerspace CTF Challenge: Code Breaker

Welcome to the "Code Breaker Challenge" from Hackerspace, a reverse engineering Capture The Flag (CTF) event! This challenge is designed to test your reverse engineering skills in a fun and educational manner. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced CTF enthusiast, this challenge aims to provide an engaging experience.

## Challenge Overview

- **Challenge Name:** Code Breaker Challenge
- **Challenge Creator:** Yash Dinesh Singh
- **Challenge Type:** Reverse Engineering CTF

## Challenge Description

In the "Code Breaker Challenge," participants are tasked with reverse engineering a Java class file to uncover a hidden flag. By analyzing and understanding the provided Java code, you'll decrypt a hidden message concealed within the code. The challenge involves logical deduction, binary manipulation, and a series of operations that lead to the final flag.

## Walkthrough Guide
